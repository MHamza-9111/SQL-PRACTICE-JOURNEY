# 📘 Class 10 - Indexes in SQL (Last Class)

## 📌 What is an Index?
An index in SQL is used to make searching and retrieving data faster.  
It works like a book index that helps find pages quickly.

There are two main types of indexes:
1. Clustered Index
2. Non-Clustered Index

---

## 📌 Clustered Index
- Stores data in sorted order.
- One clustered index is allowed per table.
- Created automatically when you set a Primary Key.

## 📌 Non-Clustered Index
- Does not change the physical order of the table.
- Creates a separate index structure.
- Multiple non-clustered indexes can be created on a table.

🏁 Summary
Indexes make searching data faster.

Clustered Index = Sorts table data.

Non-Clustered Index = Creates a separate index.

You can view all indexes using sys.indexes.

✅ This was the last class of SQL — Class 10.
